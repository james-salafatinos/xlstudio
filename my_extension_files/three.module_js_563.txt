Prefiltered, Mipmapped Radiance Environment Map
 * (PMREM) from a cubeMap environment texture. This allows different levels of
 * blur to be quickly accessed based on material roughness. It is packed into a
 * special CubeUV format that allows us to perform custom interpolation so that
 * we can support nonlinear formats such as RGBE. Unlike a traditional mipmap
 * chain, it only goes down to the LOD_MIN level (above), and then creates extra
 * even more filtered 'mips' at the same LOD_MIN resolution, associated with
 * higher roughness levels. In this way we maintain resolution to smoothly
 * interpolate diffuse lighting while limiting sampling computation.
